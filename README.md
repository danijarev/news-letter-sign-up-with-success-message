## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

As I'm pretty junior with JS I started out by building the entire project with vanilla JS. The initial solution of this project included pretty much the same HTML and CSS code, plus one JS file in which I was adding event listeners to the buttons and hiding different portions of the content depending on which button was clicked.

I used SASS for the styles

Then, I took my first solution and refactored it using React. I moved most of the content to a couple of dedicated components and made a few style modifications to have the already created styles work on the new set up.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first time actually using Sass after having learnt about it. Same thing with React. Particularly, I was not sure how to handle a form in react and I learnt about it while working on this project. React proptypes was not something outlined in the React course I'm taking so that's something else I had to learn about.

### Continued development

I know the code on this project might not be very clean and/or the best possible solution. I tried to use as many features that are provided by Sass but I know I need to keep practicing to become a power user. Same thing with React. I know I would have been able to use a class component to handle the form, but I had already built something prior to migrate the project to React so I sticked to what I had.
